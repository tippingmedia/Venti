# Venti 3 *dev*
We've been working hard to prepare Venti's next release for Craft CMS 3. Recently, we decided what was best for Venti's continued development was to open source it. While the Craft 3 version of the plugin is very raw, a significant amount of time has already been invested in its development. We will continue to develop Venti for our own purposes, but will no longer provide support beyond the customers that purchased Venti 2.

As Venti will be in a public repo we will continue to listen and dialogue around making Venti better. We see a lot of potential for this plugin, and hope the community will make it better than we have the time for. We look forward to seeing what you can do with Venti! - Adam & Brian
